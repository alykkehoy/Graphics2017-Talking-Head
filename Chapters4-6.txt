One of 4.1 or 4.2.
Four of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.8, and 6.9.

1. What are the ray parameters of the intersection points between ray (1, 1, 1)+
t(−1,−1,−1) and the sphere centered at the origin with radius 1? Note:
this is a good debugging case.
(e + td − c) · (e + td − c) − R^2 = 0
((1, 1, 1)+ t(−1,−1,−1) − 0) · ((1, 1, 1)+ t(−1,−1,−1) − 0) − 1^2 = 0
(1 - t, 1 - t, 1 - t) · (1 - t, 1 - t, 1 - t)) − 1 = 0
3(1 - t)^2 − 1 = 0
3(t^2 - 2t + 1) − 1 = 0
3t^2 - 6t + 2 = 0

t = 1 - (1 / (3^1/2))
t = 1 + (1 / (3^1/2))

1. Write down the 4 × 4 3D matrix to move by (xm, ym, zm).
[1 0 0 xm
 0 1 0 ym
 0 0 1 zm
 0 0 0 1]
2. Write down the 4 × 4 3D matrix to rotate by an angle θ about the y-axis.
[cos(θ)  0  sin(θ) 0
 0       1  0      0
 -sin(θ) 0  cos(θ) 0
 0       0  0      1]
3. Write down the 4×4 3D matrix to scale an object by 50% in all directions.
[0.5 0   0   0
 0   0.5 0   0
 0   0   0.5 0
 0   0   0   1]
4. Write the 2D rotation matrix that rotates by 90 degrees clockwise.
[cos(-π / 2) -sin(-π / 2) 0      [0  1 0
 sin(-π / 2) cos(-π / 2)  0   =   -1 0 0
 0           0            1]      0  0 1]
